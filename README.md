# DevOps Pipeline Suite

Welcome to the DevOps Pipeline Suite repository. This project is designed to automate and streamline the infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration, and continuous delivery processes using a combination of Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive DevOps pipeline, starting from infrastructure provisioning to monitoring deployed applications. The steps below outline the process of setting up and managing the entire DevOps lifecycle using various tools and technologies.

## Setup and Provisioning

1. **Setting up Terraform to facilitate infrastructure provisioning.**
    - Define Terraform configuration files to set up the infrastructure required for Jenkins, Ansible, and other tools.
    
2. **Using Terraform to provision Jenkins master, build nodes, and Ansible.**
    - Use Terraform scripts to automate the deployment of Jenkins master and build nodes, along with an Ansible server.

## Configuration Management

3. **Configuring an Ansible server.**
    - Set up an Ansible server to manage configurations and automate tasks.
    
4. **Employing Ansible to configure Jenkins master and build nodes.**
    - Use Ansible playbooks to configure Jenkins master and build nodes, ensuring they are ready for job execution.

## CI/CD Pipeline

5. **Creating a Jenkins pipeline job.**
    - Set up a Jenkins pipeline job to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
    
6. **Developing a Jenkinsfile from scratch.**
    - Write a Jenkinsfile to define the CI/CD pipeline stages and steps.
    
7. **Implementing a multibranch pipeline.**
    - Configure Jenkins to support a multibranch pipeline, enabling automated builds for multiple branches.
    
8. **Enabling webhooks on GitHub for automated triggering of CI/CD processes.**
    - Set up webhooks in GitHub to trigger Jenkins jobs automatically on code changes.

## Code Quality and Artifactory

9. **Configuring SonarQube and Sonar scanner.**
    - Install and configure SonarQube for code quality analysis.
    
10. **Executing SonarQube analysis for code quality assessment.**
    - Integrate Sonar scanner with Jenkins to perform code quality analysis during the build process.
    
11. **Defining rules and gates within SonarQube for ensuring code quality standards.**
    - Set up quality gates and rules in SonarQube to enforce code quality standards.
    
12. **Setting up Sonar callback rules.**
    - Configure SonarQube to send callbacks to Jenkins based on analysis results.

13. **Configuring JFrog Artifactory.**
    - Set up JFrog Artifactory for artifact storage and management.
    
14. **Creating Dockerfile for containerization.**
    - Write Dockerfiles to containerize applications.
    
15. **Storing Docker images on Artifactory.**
    - Use JFrog Artifactory to store and manage Docker images.

## Containerization and Orchestration

16. **Utilizing Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster.**
    - Use Terraform to create and manage a Kubernetes cluster.
    
17. **Creating Kubernetes objects.**
    - Define and create Kubernetes objects (Deployments, Services, etc.).
    
18. **Deploying Kubernetes objects using Helm.**
    - Use Helm charts to deploy applications on Kubernetes.

## Monitoring and Alerts

19. **Setting up Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.**
    - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes using Helm charts for monitoring and visualization.
    
20. **Monitoring the Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus.**
    - Configure Prometheus to monitor the Kubernetes cluster and collect metrics.
    
21. **Visualizing metrics with Grafana.**
    - Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
